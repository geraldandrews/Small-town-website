## Description
This is a front-end website project I created of a special small town in Virginia called Rocky Gap where I lived the early years of my childhood. I created this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the layout and responsiveness of the site and JavaScript for the functionality such as mobile navigation on tablets and smartphones and displaying larger versions of various images on the site, such as some photos I have taken of the town while visiting throughout the years .
