# Small Town Website
### Live Site: https://rockygapva.netlify.app/

## Description
This is a front-end website project I created of a special small town in Virginia called Rocky Gap where I lived the early years of my childhood. I created this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, Javascript, the CSS framework Bootstrap, and some photos I have taken of the town while visiting throughout the years .
