## Description:
This is a front-end website project I created of a special small town in Virginia called Rocky Gap where I lived the early years of my childhood. I created this website from scratch using HTML, CSS for the layout and responsiveness of the site and JavaScript for the functionality of the navigation, photo gallery, and thumbnail slideshow on the site.
